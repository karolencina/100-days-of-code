# #100DaysOfCode Log
The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on 29 July 2022.

### Day 1
Created a simple counter. I'm shocked to see how much JavaScript
I forgot while working in back-end. Reminded myself how to use 
the ```mv``` command and found out what the .idea directory is
all about.

### Day 2
Problem solving: GitHub was not showing up on my contributions graph. I found out that it was because my Git email address was different.

### Day 3
Added a new functionality to Counter that differentiates
between positive and negative numbers.

### Day 4
Started exploring Bootstrap. Found out what the shortcut for comments
is in WebStorm (finally!).

### Day 5
Decided to not use Bootstrap at the moment (I'm trying to get better at HTML, CSS and JS - that's my priority). I styled the reviews card and created a random data array to use in the script of Reviews. 

I decided to try and write the logic of the code on my own (without looking at the solution) and ended up breaking my browser... still not sure why.

### Day 6
I did not manage to write any code, was really busy! :(

### Day 7
Learned more about `git rebase`. I wrote an incorrect commit message but only realised two commits later, so I could not amend the commit in the usual way (`git commit --amend`). I looked it the issue up on Stack Overflow and the solution I found worked for me. I added a random review functionality to my script almost on my own. I still don't clearly understand the logic behind generating random numbers between two specific values, so I'm currently looking into it.

### Day 8
Looked for an alternative way to add icons to my projects (I don't want to have to download a large set of icons only to use 2 of them). I looked into Material Design icons on Google Fonts which are meant to replace icon glyphs but it didn't work as expected.

### Day 9
I did not manage to get anything done.

### Day 10
I created an HTML + CSS setup for the Navbar project. This was quite simple and I learned how the logic will work (it is yet to be implemented).

### Day 11
I did not get anything done as I arrived home late.

### Day 12
The individual project files' CSS was partly duplicated for each project (especially the global variables), so I created a global.css file and linked it to each project as an additional stylesheet. I created a links toggle functionality when user clicks on the hamburger menu - I paused my YT tutorial and did this almost completely on my own.
