# #100DaysOfCode Log
The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on 29 July 2022.

### Day 1
Created a simple counter. I'm shocked to see how much JavaScript
I forgot while working in back-end. Reminded myself how to use 
the ```mv``` command and found out what the .idea directory is
all about.

### Day 2
Problem solving: GitHub was not showing up on my contributions graph.
I found out that it was because my Git email address was different.

### Day 3
Added a new functionality to the Counter project that differentiates
between positive and negative numbers.
