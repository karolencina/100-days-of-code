# #100DaysOfCode Log
The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on 29 July 2022.

### Day 1
Created a simple counter. I'm shocked to see how much JavaScript
I forgot while working in back-end. Reminded myself how to use 
the ```mv``` command and found out what the .idea directory is
all about.

### Day 2
Problem solving: GitHub was not showing up on my contributions graph. I found out that it was because my Git email address was different.

### Day 3
Added a new functionality to Counter that differentiates
between positive and negative numbers.

### Day 4
Started exploring Bootstrap. Found out what the shortcut for comments
is in WebStorm (finally!).

### Day 5
Decided to not use Bootstrap at the moment (I'm trying to get better at HTML, CSS and JS - that's my priority). I styled the reviews card and created a random data array to use in the script of Reviews. 

I decided to try and write the logic of the code on my own (without looking at the solution) and ended up breaking my browser... still not sure why.
