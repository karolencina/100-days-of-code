# #100DaysOfCode Log
The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on 29 July 2022.

### Day 1 | 29/07/22
Created a simple counter. I'm shocked to see how much JavaScript
I forgot while working in back-end. Reminded myself how to use 
the ```mv``` command and found out what the .idea directory is
all about.

### Day 2 | 30/07/22
Problem solving: GitHub was not showing up on my contributions graph. I found out that it was because my Git email address was different.

### Day 3 | 31/07/22
Added a new functionality to Counter that differentiates
between positive and negative numbers.

### Day 4 | 01/08/22
Started exploring Bootstrap. Found out what the shortcut for comments
is in WebStorm (finally!).

### Day 5 | 02/08/22
Decided to not use Bootstrap at the moment (I'm trying to get better at HTML, CSS and JS - that's my priority). I styled the reviews card and created a random data array to use in the script of Reviews. 

I decided to try and write the logic of the code on my own (without looking at the solution) and ended up breaking my browser... still not sure why.

### Day 6 | 03/08/22
I did not manage to write any code, was really busy! :(

### Day 7 | | 05/08/22
Learned more about `git rebase`. I wrote an incorrect commit message but only realised two commits later, so I could not amend the commit in the usual way (`git commit --amend`). I looked it the issue up on Stack Overflow and the solution I found worked for me. I added a random review functionality to my script almost on my own. I still don't clearly understand the logic behind generating random numbers between two specific values, so I'm currently looking into it.

### Day 8 | 08/08/22
Looked for an alternative way to add icons to my projects (I don't want to have to download a large set of icons only to use 2 of them). I looked into Material Design icons on Google Fonts which are meant to replace icon glyphs but it didn't work as expected.

### Day 9 | 09/08/22
I did not manage to get anything done.

### Day 10 | 10/08/22
I created an HTML + CSS setup for the Navbar project. This was quite simple and I learned how the logic will work (it is yet to be implemented).

### Day 11 | 12/08/22
I did not get anything done as I arrived home late.

### Day 12 | 13/08/22
The individual project files' CSS was partly duplicated for each project (especially the global variables), so I created a global.css file and linked it to each project as an additional stylesheet. I created a links toggle functionality when user clicks on the hamburger menu - I paused my YT tutorial and did this almost completely on my own.

### Day 13

### \<to be changed> | 24/08/22
Perhaps the main event today was not writing code. By no means am I trying to discount the importance of finally having a better understanding of practical use cases of the ``forEach`` method, but I started updating my daily log!(!!). After re-reading it and comparing it with my Git commits and browser history, I realised that neglecting my log not only makes me look lazier than I really have been, but it also makes it painfully easy to forget the process of learning and the effort I have been putting into this journey.
